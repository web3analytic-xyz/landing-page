# Landing Page

Contains code for the Pareto landing page. Written in React.

In the project directory, you can run `npm start`. This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

Since this is a static page, we host it in S3. To compile the project, run `npm run build`. This will create a new build folder that should be moved to a bucket.
